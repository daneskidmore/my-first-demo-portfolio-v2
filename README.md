## Description ##

This is my first time creating a webpage from scratch on my own, as well as using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Instead of using major CSS and media queries I got help with styling, creating a responsive webpage that is interactive with Bootstrap. In each of the three linked pages there is one common navigation bar to help guide the user:


    1. Contact Me
    2. Porfolrio
    3. About Me

I started this project with my study group to throw ideas of how to achieve a functioning page that matched the class example. My suggestion was to first design the page on paper, then architect how to achieve the desired outcome. 

My first step was creating the repository, followed by creating the HTML and READ.me files inside of it, then cloning the repository to my desktop. After which I put in basic HTML page formatting to each file. 

The first design and functional part of the webpage was the Navigation Bar. I created the desired look and funciton through trial and error inside of Visual Studio Code editor until I was able to successful find a match. I then pasted the same formatted navigation bar into each of the three HTML pages using <"href">. 

I followed next by finding and adding a <"footer"> from Bootstrap to each of the three pages. 
I decided at this point that I'd need to do a <"style"> sheet to help with the background <"img">, as well as other elements in the pages. For example card height, and clearfix display format. 


I then tackled the three pages seperately because each would have their own design and layout. The first page I tackled was the contact me page. I found a desired <"form"> through trail and error in Bootstrap. The form is fairly simple and includes 3 fields: name, email and message with a submit button. 

The second page I designed was the About Me page. I used a container to help with stylibng which include a basic row with <"h1"> title, another 2 which after trouble shooting i used <"col-md-6"> to get the ideal spacing between the text, and images. Lastley I created a 3rd row in which contained 4 clickable icons that led to external webpages for my: GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram Account and my Resume. 

Here is an example of the code I used in Bootstrap per recommendation and research with my peer below:
```{language-extension}<{<div class="col-md-4 text-center">
    <div class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic Example">
    <a class="btn btn-outline-info border-right-0" href="https://github.com/daneskidmore" role="button"target="_blank"><img class="logo" src="githubicon.jpeg" alt="github page"></a>
</div> 
```

Due to the complexity I saved the Portfollio page for last so I could focus more time on it. I started trying to repeat the column process I did on the About Me page, which actually worked however after a few days of thinking about the work I decided it would be best to design it for future updates and links to my work. I found a nice peice of code that allowed for an adjustable screen size by setting the margins to auto + using "mx-auto."

## Future Improvements ##

As I learn more programming langauges like JavaScript and JQUERY I will make my portfollio pages more custom, function and containing assets I build out over time. I am sure some styling and formatting changes are in my future as well.
